    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hi y'all. Sometimes I don't wanna wait for November to get into the fall dishes. One of my
      favorite dishes to make outside the fall season is a spiced cranberry sauce. This recipe is
      based on an Aunt's recipe, but with some modifications, including using mace instead of the
      more potent nutmeg. If you don't have access to mace you can subsitute with nutmeg to your
      tastes. I've sometimes had this warm, but it does kinda taste better chilled or room tempurature
      in some situations, such as being used in a leftovers sandwich with dressing.
