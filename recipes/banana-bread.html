    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hi y'all. It's been very cold and windy here for me, and I start to
      crave foods with warm spices during this time of year. One of my
      favorite things to bake is banana bread. The aroma and warmth of the
      cinnamon and cloves combined with the buttery richness and sweetness
      of brown sugar and banana bring me a lot of comfort, and I hope it
      does the same for you.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prep:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to <strong>350F</strong>.</li>
      <li>Prepare three bowls, one bread pan, a hand mixer, and optionally
        one baking sheet for roasting walnuts.
      </li>
      <li><strong>If roasting walnuts:</strong> chop 100 g of walnuts and 
        place onto baking sheet, spacing them out evenly. After oven is 
        heated, roast for 7-10 minutes. Keep an eye on them to ensure 
        they don't burn. Once roasted, take walnuts out and set aside to
        begin preparing the batter. <em>Do not turn off the oven yet. </em>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Mixing:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In one bowl, whisk together dry ingredients and set aside.</li>
      <li>In another bowl, mash bananas with a fork until smooth and set aside.</li>
      <li>In final bowl, add softened butter and brown sugar. Using a hand
        mixer, cream them together until light and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>On medium speed, add the eggs and yolk one at a time to the
        creamed butter and sugar until mixed well.
      </li>
      <li>On low speed, mix in mashed bananas and vanilla extract to the
        rest of the wet mixture.</li>
      <li>Now slowly mix in the dry ingredients until no pockets of flour
        remain. <em>Take care not to overmix!</em>
      </li>
      <li>Finally, if you roasted walnuts, gently fold them into the mixture.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Baking:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Oil or butter the bread pan and spoon in the final mixture.</li>
      <li>Bake on the center rack for about <strong>50min - 1hr</strong>, checking in to make
        sure it doesn't burn.
      </li>
      <li>At the 50min mark, check with a fork or toothpick. There should
        be little to no dough left over when it's ready.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool for a while so it can settle properly.</li>
      <li>Cut and serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Preserving</h2>
    <p>Cover and store at room temp for up to 2 days. Banana bread can also be refrigerated up to 1 week or tightly
        wrapped and frozen up to 4 months. Thaw frozen loaves, wrapped or
        unwrapped, in the fridge or at room temp.</p>
