    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hi y'all. Baking bread can be intimidating. It definately
      was for me at first, but even the duds can still be enjoyable to eat
      as well as teach you about how the ingredients interact with eachother.
      Even better is once you get into the groove, you can find yourself
      baking your own bread instead of buying it from the store &lpar;but
      a loaf from your favorite local bakery every now and then wouldn't
      hurt&rpar;. You may also find yourself becoming more comfortable
      adjusting the recipe as you learn more to fit you desired tastes.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This recipe was designed with the use of a dutch oven in mind, but modifications
      for a bread pan are included.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>300g bread flour</li>
      <li>150g whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>50g rolled oats &lpar;plus more for topping&rpar;</li>
      <li>2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
      <li>70g brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>

      <li>4 tbsp avocado oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prep:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix warm water, oats, brown sugar together in a large bowl and add yeast to it.</li>
      <li>While the yeast activates, grab another large bowl and mix together the flours and kosher salt.</li>
      <li>Gradually stir-in dry mixture to the wet mixture until the forming dough stops clinging to the bowl.</li>
      <li>Turn out dough onto dry surface and knead for 5 minutes. <em>Only add more flour if the mixture is too wet to knead!</em></li>
      <li>Place dough into an oiled bowl, cover with a lightly wet cloth or cling film, and let rise for approximately 2hrs or until dough has doubled in size.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bake Prep:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>When ready to start baking, make space with oven racks for your dutch oven. Then preheat oven to <strong>400F</strong></li>
      <li>Preheat dutch oven for 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> if you want to use a bread pan instead, the risen dough will need to be topped, coiled, and then
    transferred to an oiled and lightly oat-bedded pan for a second rise for about 30 minutes. You can then skip the dutch oven prep and <em>
      reduce oven tempurature to <strong>325F</strong></em>, then score the dough and bake for 30 minutes or until browned and not too wet in the center.
    </p>
    <h3>Baking:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Turn risen dough out onto dry surface and shape into a ball, pinching the bottom seems together.</li>
      <li>Lightly oil the dough ball and roll into sprinkle of oats so that they stick to the surface.</li>
      <li>Prepare parchment paper and lightly sprinkle a bed of oats, then transfer dough ball onto the parchment and score with a sharp blade.</li>
      <li>Using mits, pull out rack and open preheated dutch oven. Then carefully place dough ball with parchment inside.</li>
      <li>Place a bit of water around the bread so steam can help form the crust. Recover with lid and close oven to <strong>bake for approximately 30 minutes or until nicely browned</strong></li>
      <li>Check bread with skewer or thermometer when it looks ready and make sure it's not still wet in the middle before removing from oven.</li>
      <li>Remove from oven and let cool and settle for at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Preserving</h2>
    <p>The bread can be kept out for a few days if covered, or it can be refrigerated or frozen to preserve it for longer.
      Thick slices of stale bread are great for french toast!
